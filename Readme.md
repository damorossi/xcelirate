# This is an app made for Xcelirate as a test

# Used scss, a few tests, and a build module

# if build-js command fails, some problems may come with global browserify
# run command from terminal will compile.

# need a liveServer or any node server to point 'build/index.html'

# after excecute server, http://127.0.0.1:5500/coverage/lcov-report/index.html to get test coverage.

# if want to check tests run the command : npm run test
